# Eye-Winking-Mouse
This project involved utilizing computer vision techniques to track the movement of the user's eyes and detect winks as input commands. 
I implemented a combination of image processing algorithms and machine learning models to accurately identify eye movements 
and distinguish intentional winks from natural blinking. 
By integrating the project with mouse control functionalities, 
I enabled users to navigate and interact with the computer using winks as a hands-free input method.
